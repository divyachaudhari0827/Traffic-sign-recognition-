# Traffic sign recognition 
Traffic sign recognition is a technology used in vehicles to automatically identify and understand road signs.These algorithms can detect various types of signs such as speed limits, stop signs, yield signs, and more. Once a sign is recognized, the system can provide relevant information to the driver, such as displaying the speed limit or warning about upcoming road conditions. This helps enhance driver awareness and safety on the road by providing timely and accurate information.


# Dataset
In this project, we've used a dataset called the "German traffic sihn recognition" for recognizing the traffic signs ." The dataset contains Single-image, multi-class classification problem More than 40 classes, More than 50,000 images in total Large, lifelikeÂ database.
Each traffic sign is associated with its class.
